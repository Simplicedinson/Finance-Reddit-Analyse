User_1: ASML said that net bookings, a key indicator of order demand, came in at 7.09 billion euros.

That was up 169% from the 2.63 billion euros ASML reported in the third quarter, and exceeded the 3.99 billion euros expected by analysts polled by Visible Alpha, according to Reuters.
User_2: Stock just off its base back in November 20th, slow climb to about 8.2% from that date and it should be better than U.S. semiconductor stocks effected by tariffs.
