Post Title: DeepseekV3 outperforms GPT-o4 and Llma in benchmark test. Anyone can run the test them to verify.
Post Text: 
To the arrogant ones who dismissed Deepseek as mere copy-and-paste simply because it's Chinese, stop embarassing yourself out of ignorance. It outperforms GPT-o4 and Llma in benchmark test. Anyone can run the test them to verify.

Comments:
User_1: I‚Äôm not suspicious about the outperformance, I‚Äôm suspicious about the reported cost to achieve that outperformance.
User_2: Oh they need humans Engineers, and well-paid now. Interesting!
User_3: Fuck that loser posing as a 40 year old fuckboy. Meta is already ancient
User_4: Because the chinese government is so truthful.
User_5: First of all, there's no o4. It's 4o.

Second, 4o is literally the free-for-all model. It's not state of the art.

That'd be o1, o1 pro and soon to be o3.

User_7: I have run the test. The answer is 7 miles.
User_8: People keep talking about price, what factors affect the price of these things?
User_9: War Room. I love the way tech bros like using war metaphors, and army analogies for everything. It used to sicken me when I worked at certain places .. wait, I had a point to make... Oh yeah, Zuck Fuckerberg!
User_10: They used H100s and they used chatgpt api calls
User_11: Just to clarify. Deepseek R1:671b outperforms o4 and Llma. But unless you have some beefy hardware, YOU won‚Äôt be running it with that level of performance at home. Unless you have a handful of 3090s sitting around. There are smaller models (14b) that can run on lower power hardware, but that‚Äôs an apples or oranges comparison at that point.
User_12: The billionaire tech firms will want to shoot this down and down play it quickly. The arrogance is all there to see. Nobody can do it better than than us is the message it must be fake ü§£
User_13: This story again? Meta should scramble to to war rooms to work out how to make a good product.

User_19: War room budget - 10 billion dollars
User_20: S
User_21: I‚Äôm not big into the computer science stuff. Someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.

But isn‚Äôt this a coding/programing issue?

If so why is it that big of a deal when the better hardware has the ability to outperform?

Chinese companies aren‚Äôt exactly known for being upfront about their financials so not sure if I believe the cost. And I wonder how much they pay their employees. Probably slave labor costs compared to the US

Yea I‚Äôm willing to bet if deep-seek was required to pay livable wages in the United States the cost wouldn‚Äôt be so low.
User_22: Millions of dollars spent in war rooms. I have the answer China stole ChatGPT‚Äòs research and development and since they did not have to put that much time into RND they were able to make it faster and cheaper. Simple
User_23: Meanwhile I‚Äôm deleting Facebook and insta today, need to figure out how I‚Äôm not counted as an active user and planting seeds that to friends and family we don‚Äôt need the dopamine from these platforms. We are all weak and they feed on us
User_24: Zuckerberg and War Room üòÇ
User_25: This is the technology innovation cycle. It takes a TON of research and resources to first bring something new into existence, and then the next iterations come faster and cheaper. Unfortunately the US got trapped in phase 1 and so the Chinese took on the optimization game. Too bad we aren‚Äôt collaborating instead of competing.
User_26: It‚Äôs called good programming. Might try it sometime
User_27: Zuck.... lol. Can't steal this one lizard boy.....
User_28: lol. Cyber zuck is just mad someone made some cool internet thing before him. Efff meta
User_29: It‚Äôs literally Chinese propaganda attacking the USA stock market. 6 million more like 6 billion‚Ä¶ hence there app literally crashed and got a massive cyber attack because it‚Äôs a pile of dog shit app making everyone believe it‚Äôs better then ChatGPT. All this APP dose is search books and websites and takes an extra minute to find it then it gives you the details on your question. Nothing about it is smarter then humans which ChatGBT has said in next coming years there AI will be able to answer questions us humans don‚Äôt have answers too. Massive buying opportunity right now.

This week Meta be like ‚Äúwe want all our engineers working overtime to fire themselves!‚Äù

User_31: Why don't they just employ AI to build AI models? / S but also maybe a solution?
User_32: From my understanding, the US base AI holds way more data, and this deepseek stuff just has answers to common questions, not the full content of the full dataset. Is that correct?
User_33: Hoolichat left the chat

User_44: Going to be interesting to see if this has indeed been quietly funded by the Chinese government. Either way, the Deep Seek devs have done a great job.
User_45: ah yes, the new chadgpt o4 llm
User_46: Isn‚Äôt this just like 20 years ago when China burst onto the global automotive scene? And every political pundit and economist said everyone would drive a Chinese car within a decade building cars at Mercedes or BMW level for less than the price of a basic Ford Focus. 

Fast forward 2 decades still nobody drives a Chinese car. Because Chinese manufacturers lied about manufacturing costs, lied about car performance/build quality and ripped off every major manufacturer to make their products appear decent to shake the market. But they still rocked markets for a few years. 

At the moment this has to be viewed as, potentially at least, just the CCP escalating the proxy war with Trump over Chinese tariffs and trying to manipulate the optics of his bans on Chinese tech firms.
User_47: That reminds me of Rocket Lab USA RKLB saying that they can do the job (NASA) for less than half price.
User_48: $6 million if you dont have to pay for labor or pay in chinese pesos üë∫
User_49: Deepseek is absolutely garbage. Try to use it and you will see what I'm talking about. I prefer gpt.

User_51: i heard they copied openai
User_52: They used AI to build a better AI.
User_53: [deleted]
User_54: Just another example of China stealing something from the U.S. and calling it Chinese. DeepSeek uses American NVIDIA chips. Chips China obtained illegally. DeepSeek would not work without American chips. Meaning American AI can continue to improve with nothing from China. Whereas, China can do nothing with AI unless America provides the chips for it.

Anyone on the planet can read through it, modify it, see if they are indeed collecting data, improve it if they want, and mainly, anyone can download it and run it.

Go to any nerd forum or sub in here and you'll see people trying to run it on their machines... I have skimmed through it and for now it really seems it works faster on the same hardware, but it could be hyped up (people celebrating what they are told to celebrate)
        Reply: DrXaos: They‚Äôre a hedge fund.  They probably shorted NVidia etc, and then claim they trained their model very cheaply.  They just made all their funding for their next generation without having to give up any share to a VC fund.

I read the paper with colleagues.  It is certainly true they are extremely skilled and have put tons of work authentically into capabilities and efficiency, and have hard core CUDA developers on staff (probably from HFT originally). Many years of work.

But I suspect they have access to many top end chips which they are not supposed to have.  An anomalously high fraction of NVidia revenue is to Singapore, which doesn‚Äôt have the power capacity at all to employ them domestically.
        Reply: TechTuna1200: Even if it is more it's still a fraction of the CAPEX of the other tech giant. You can't sneak 40B USD worth of GPUs without anybody noticing. Maybe 2-4B but definitely 40B.   
  
Also, it's been replicated in a smaller version for 30 USD at Berkley. You can pretty much extrapolate that it is somewhere in the ballpark that deepseek claims.

It's either...

- A model with back-end data sale revenue factored into the bottom-line cost

If anyone has an incentive to lie about the cost of developing AI it would be all the firms being paid billions to develop it forever and almost but never quite reach an end. Milk the investors for as long as possible.

The Chinese have a limited budget and tech, they have an incentive to get out a working product.

Now another company launched a car (nissan gtr) that can go at same speed for just 150k, so this is an example of how is deepSeek able to perform the same tasks as chat gpt for a lot less, if thats true, it would be amazing. But im neutral in view if its true or not.

So the factor is that with less capital is able to do the same as big tech titan's AI, and bc china cant access nvda and other cloud computing services, its from chinese chips. Hope it helps

Why would they compete with BMW and Mercedes on fossil fuel vehicles? The Chinese have been channeling their R&D, design, and manufacturing efforts into scaling up the entire EV ecosystem for the past two decades. They are now the undisputed leaders in EV and  on par in AV technology with US. They have the most EV and AV on the roads than in any other country.

I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre from. Perhaps your country isn‚Äôt ready for EVs, no EV, or AV infrastructure, or your government is protecting the fossil fuel automobile industry by restricting Chinese EV imports. Have you been to a car show in China or driven a Chinese EV before? If not, you should; otherwise, you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.

That‚Äôs it. This is quite common in ML papers for benchmarking. That is what the final run cost and it is objectively true. 

However obviously there is a lot more going one from testing, ablations runs over hardware cost and salaries to data gathering, cleaning, processing.

No sane person claim that you could develop such a thing for 6 mil. It‚Äôs bullshit journalism and bait.

Even if Deepseek has replicated what OpenAI achieved for a fraction of the cost (still heavy doubt in my mind), it is only a replication and not innovation. So it‚Äôs just not comparable. 

And getting back to an investment pov, the markets reaction yesterday was wildly out of proportion. Theres now even claims that Deepseek didn‚Äôt use H800 Nvidia chips, as they reported, but the H100 chips. Bringing us back around to doubt around their reported cost‚Ä¶

That's like saying NVidia Grace only took 20M to develop. 

Because a mask at TSMC for 3nm is 20M. 

Let's not count the billions of dollars of research and development, salaries, IPs, EDA tools, MPW wafers for each individual IP, etc into the development cost.

It being open source is great, and means I can test the cost of a final training run (to an extent) but doesn‚Äôt change the question mark over true infrastructure costs. No one actually trusts the Chinese in this area; been caught lying too many times and there is too much incentive for them to be lying again now.

The model being open source doesn't matter as it relates to their most significant claims (efficient training). The white paper also doesn't explain how that training was done beyond a theoretical approach. They left out some bare minimum stuff like training logs as well.

As such, they are not trying to fleece rube investors and they are working on less powerful hardware. They have other advantages, but there is no market incentive to just keep asking for more and more cash or stringing together more and more hardware. They have to actually refine their code.

Think about it like a nice porsche. The price per unit is let‚Äôs say a 100k. That‚Äôs the manufacturing cost per unit. It‚Äôs undoubtedly true and can be verified. 

The thing is the cost of developing this exact car clearly consist of more than just manufacturing. You have r and d, all the tests and engineers salaries plus a good chunk for machines.

Now with deepseek it‚Äôs the same. The model can be run for 6mil that is just math and already verified and what they stated in the paper. The issue is that motherfuckers claim you can develop it for 6 mil which was never claimed by anyone. Take the car analogy. Of course you can manufacture it for 100k but there is a shit ton more going on behind the scenes which was never said to be zero in the first place.

So yea running the model (assuming you get everything right the first time and don‚Äôt have to pay salaries and shit) is possible for 6mil like they stated and people told you. Developing the model is a whole other story though.

Tech companies are afraid because the 6mil to just ran the exact model is still cheap af especially considering the performance

They haven't explained how they did it. 

Note: I've read the paper thoroughly, and I work in this space...am published in this space (tho not specifically on LLMs) and there are some gaping omissions from the paper. A lot of the part that matters is glossed over. People assume that open source = everything is on display...its not. 

At the end of the day, the claims (that matter) are all centered around the training and the text *does* tell a coherent story about how they might have kept the training cost down (MoE sparsity, extensive communication overlap, FP8 training for memory savings, etc.). They also give a high‚Äêlevel cluster size (2048 H800 GPUs), a total token count (14.8T), and a final GPU‚Äêhour tally (\~2.788M).

However for someone to verify or replicate these costs independently, you need fine‚Äêgrained metrics:

* Actual tokens/second or steps/second logs
* Per‚Äêstep or per‚Äêepoch timing measurements
* Confirmation of concurrent GPU usage over the full duration

Right now, the paper provides plausibility arguments but not a fully transparent set of logs. In large‚Äêscale LLM publications, that is unfortunately common.

Furthermore, given where this model originated - I am highly skeptical about this 'breakthrough'. but am happy to be proven wrong (in fact I welcome it).

Don't get me wrong. This is in the realm of the *possible* however unlikely. And thats why everyone is reacting so 'extremely'. If the claims are accurate - this represents a paradigm shift that could have serious impacts on the industry - if they are not then its a nothingburger. You bet your ass every ai/chip company is going to be scrambling to figure out the scope of this - they just got hit with a new bit of information that they were not expecting. 

 Its super sketchy because - there are A LOT of gaps in what they have claimed, and moreso its a relatively unknown company from China. For risk of sounding xenophobic...China is for all intents and purposes, our enemy, and they aren't known to be the most, um 'upfront'. AI is an arms race as much as it is a great virtual assistant. 

Listen, I'm rooting for this to be true. I work in AI, this could change the face of the way that I do work for the better. But I've also seen the amount of snake oil salesmen in the AI space. These are all corporations who are trying to make a buck, lets not lose sight of that.

This is a truly wild statement. I cant make that clear enough. If you are releasing research - the onus is 100% on you to prove your claims. They can do that, but they didnt. If you've ever published peer reviewed works, you should know this (I assume you havent).

>They do provide details on new activation function and techniques which researchers can replicate.

I dont know how much clearer I can be....They. Do. Not. This statement is wrong.

There is both an inference and a training component.

For inference they provide sufficiently details to re‚Äêimplement or load the publicly released checkpoints functionally. But even this is lacking custom kernel details.

But Training (what we all care about) supplies architecture, key hyper‚Äêparameters, and many design notes (like DualPipe, MoE gating, FP8), but they are missing key components curation details, HPC scheduling, custom kernel code, etc...

This would be fine if they provided logs and sufficient evidence to back up their claims but again...They. Do. Not.

Basically what they've done is say "my car can go 0-60 in 2 seconds because it has turbos" and shown us a picture of the engine...sure thats in the realm of possibility...but until you show me a time slip, I have no reason to believe such a bold claim.

You think meta would be spinning up 'war rooms' to validate these claims if it were as simple as 'just download the code from github bruh'

>OpenAI is closed source everything, no details in whitepaper. Do you somehow doubt their costs as well?

The cope here. OpenAI is not releasing research into the ether (ethical debate aside). I dont care if they trained it on freaking hamster wheels. They also haven't released cost to train....so I dont really have anything to 'doubt'.

China is a socialist state and the government has agency over the private sector (for example Alibaba). So it is relevant to consider government involvement in anything produced by China.

To be clear, I don't agree that the Chinese government has anything to so with Deepseek. But I also don't think it's unreasonable to consider the possibility.

>Why aren't you associate OpenAI to US government too?

The US is a capilist economy and so it is less likely to have agency over a privately run company like OpenAI. But that doesn't mean it's impossible for the two to be associated.

But no one is questioning the validity of ChatGPT. Deepseek is the product under the microscope here because it claims much more incredible results than anything currently produced. So although OpenAI can be associated with the US government, I don't see any reason to include OpenAI or the US government into this conversation.

>My point is that the US government is just as corrupt and untruthful.

My point is that it's weird for you to bring in the US government at all. The original comment was about the Chinese government. Maybe the comment was unfair but that commentor made no comparison with the US nor did they say they were from the US. So why did you go out of your way to bring in the US government? Why not Korea or South Africa or Netherlands?
Why don't you read the comment above "Because the chinese government is so truthful"? 

> Why make baseless assumptions just because Deepseek is a Chinese company?

I don't disagree that it might be a baseless assumption. But my question is why was your reaction to a baseless assumption about the Chinese government to randomly bring in the US government? I understand if the commentor made some comparison with the US but he didn't mention them at all.

Meta isn't making wild claims that literally shaved 600b off the market cap of the world's most valuable company. No one cares about their training as it's not revolutionary.

Jfc...I'm not asking for every bit of code. Are you thick. I'm saying publish your training logs. Logs =/= code.

America EV sales were 1.3 million throughout 2024 BYD delivered almost 600,000 EV‚Äôs and Tesla deliver almost 500,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024 alone. The American EV market isn‚Äôt the monster you‚Äôre making it out to be
