“Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,” Biden said in a statement.

“But guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Vice President, and now President, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.”

And while basically everyone agrees pardoning hunter wasn't a great move, you can't be fucking serious that you think thats its the same level as trump. Biden pardoned his family and others as a protection against retaliation. Trump pardoned violent criminals because they're friends or loyal.

Both are well within their right to do so as this is entirely within the scope of their office and legal. But they both send extremely different messages.

                        Reply: JudgmentMajestic2671: Against retaliation? Hmm why would Trump retaliate??? Is it because the last administration tried to persecute him with completely bogus nonsense? Or is it just orange man bad? 

Lmao Biden literally pardoned his family but Trump is bad because he did friends/loyal.... Do you even read what you write? 

They only send different messages to you because you're biased as hell.

                            Reply: Imperce110: I think what they're talking about is the commutation for 37  federal death row prisoners from a death sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. 

Big difference from a pardon, i think.
                            Reply: JudgmentMajestic2671: Yeah, what Biden did is way worse. I agree.

Could you explain to me why this is horrific? These people will spend their life locked away from the public. They can never hurt anyone again. There are zero bad things that come from this.

Trump actually did those things he was charged for. The problem is nobody had the stones to actually follow through. He's also an actual, literal felon. Who you elected.. as president.. he should be doing jail time, but again nobody has the stones to do it.

If you honestly dont see your own bias, you're already lost.  The two are not the same. Not even a little.

Hope the next 4 years goes well for you. You asked for this.

He also had a firearm in his car at the time.

There was also Daniel Ball, who was a felon before the pardon (domestic violence battery by strangulation and resisting lawenforcement) who managed to get arrested yet again because he was in illegal possession of a firearm.

Trump knows how to pick who he pardons alright, especially since Daniel Ball was accused of throwing an explosive device into the Lower West Terrace tunnel, during the capitol riot.
