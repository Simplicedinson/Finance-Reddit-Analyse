# [Stock futures are little changed as investors await Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were near the flatline on Wednesday as investors turned toward the first Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2025.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched down 13 points. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.3% higher, while S&P 500 futures was trading around the flatline.
*****
> Tech stocks on Tuesday led the S&P 500 higher and brought the Nasdaq Composite to a 2% gain. The two indexes made a comeback after incurring sharp losses on Monday in a sell-off spurred by the emergence of China’s DeepSeek and the threat it poses to the artificial intelligence trade. Nvidia, which suffered a roughly 17% decline Monday, jumped nearly 9% on Tuesday.
*****
> “As far as the DeepSeek news over the weekend, at the end of the day today, there really hasn’t been that much of an impact on a market-wide basis,” Bespoke Investment Group co-founder Paul Hickey said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> The Fed’s interest rate decision on Wednesday is now a focal point for investors, as well as Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference. Fed funds futures data reflect a nearly 100% certainty that the central bank will keep rates steady at a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, according to CME Group data.
*****
> “When it comes to the Fed, they’re widely not expected to do anything tomorrow and that’s a good thing. The less the Fed has to do, the better it is for the market, in our view,” Hickey added.
*****
> Investors will be paying especially close attention to Powell’s comments — his first press conference in President Donald Trump’s second term. The two have had a contentious relationship dating back to Trump’s first term. The president has already said he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”
*****
> A volley of Big Tech earnings are due Wednesday afternoon, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla issuing their quarterly reports.

Tuesday’s bounce followed a 17% plunge on Monday that resulted in close to $600 billion in lost market cap – the biggest one-day loss for a U.S. company in history – after Chinese startup DeepSeek’s cheaper, open-source AI model exacerbated fears over tech spending and U.S. leadership in the space.

    Reply: PrognosticatorofLife: PLTR reporting on Monday. Place your bets!
        Reply: gitartruls01: Hope so, it stopped falling about 20 minutes after open yesterday so it's following the pattern so far, but it just reached -3.5% which isn't a great sign.

Looks like it may already be starting to bouncing back as I write this though

Edit: pattern seems to be the same but more temperamental today
            Reply: busy_investor: Hopefully we will also see that sharp increase today
                Reply: gitartruls01: Doesn't look great so far
