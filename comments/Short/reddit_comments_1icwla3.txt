Post Title: Mizuho and Needham both raise SoFi stock price target to $20.
Post Text: **Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev, a 4.19-Star Wall Street Analyst raises the SoFi stock price target from $16 to $20 on strong fundamentals, reiterating the Outperform rating.**

**Yesterday, Kyle Peterson a 4.06-star Wall Street Analyst at Needham also raised the price target from $13 to $20 with a buy rating. He was the first to ask questions at Monday's Earnings Call Q&A.**

***Mizuho:***

"The firm's analyst highlighted the underlying strength of SoFi's business, pointing to robust fundamentals and a positive medium-term revenue guide for 2025 as reasons for the price target uplift. This optimism is supported by SoFi's impressive 27.8% revenue growth over the last twelve months"

"The analyst emphasized that SoFi's strategic investments are expected to continue to drive its customer acquisition momentum, as evidenced by the growing ratio of Financial Services products to Lending products, which has increased to 6.3 times from 5.7 times in 2023."

"Furthermore, the analyst noted that many of the negative arguments previously held against SoFi have been addressed. One of the key indicators of improvement is the continued decline in net charge-offs (NCOs), which has persisted even after accounting for sales of delinquent loans."

"SoFi continues to demonstrate its ability to execute on its growth strategy."

***Needham:***

"Analyst Kyle Peterson highlighted SoFi’s strong Q4 performance, driven by higher net interest income and a non-recurring tax benefit that boosted capital ratios. 

Peterson viewed the 10% pullback in shares as a buying opportunity, emphasizing future growth from high-profile deals such as the U.S. Treasury Direct program and capital-light tailwinds from a major loan platform deal with Blue Owl Capital, both expected to contribute meaningfully by FY2026.

***(IMHO, the following 5 quoted paragraphs from the earnings call are part of the overall "AWS of Fintech")***

"Our loan platform business recently **agreed to initial terms with Blue Owl Capital Funds for up to $5 billion of personal loans over two years**. **Once finalized, this arrangement will represent our largest LPB agreement to date.**"

"We recently were **selected by the U.S. Department of Treasury for Direct Express, a prepaid debit card program that approximately 3.4 million people use to access their federal benefits**. This is a testament to our tech platform's differentiated offering as well as our strength and reliability. We're excited about the integration that will take place in 2025 and the **financial impact that we will see in 2026**."

"We ***just signed a large U.S.-based financial services provider*** that offers short-term consumer loans, card services, check cashing, and other financial products. They've built a large, loyal, and highly active debit card portfolio over the past two decades and will now rely on our technology to power existing and new capabilities. **Once they fully transition to our platform in early 2026, they will be a top 10 client on a revenue basis**."

 "We've **signed a partnership with a leading hotel rewards brand for a co-branded debit card program** launching in the first half of '25."

"This past year, we created greater optionality to meet the strong demands from our members and capital markets buyers through **LPB (Loan Platform Business)**. Here's **how it works**: We partner with buyers like ***Fortress*** to originate loans fitting their predefined criteria, and **we earn fee income as we fill the orders. These loans are originated on the buyer's behalf so they don't sit on our balance sheet. And importantly, we keep the servicing rights.** This model is a **game changer**. It allows us to serve more members, including people that we might have otherwise declined for a variety of factors **without taking on incremental risk or capital**. It further diversifies our revenue with additional **fee-based income**, and because we keep the relationship, we have the opportunity to provide the members with additional products and services. In 2024, we originated $2.1 billion of loans through LPB, which brought our total company loan originations to $23 billion."

User_1: Lots of posts about SoFi after the ER, presumably because it went down despite good results. 

No need to overcomplicate it, SoFi continues to grow while maintaining profitably.  That is all you need to know.  

The compounded growth will result in compounded earnings.  So many revenue streams, so many opportunities for synergy and efficiencies to be improved.  

I am very confident in continued growth, continued over-delivers in ERs, and continued profitability.  

That means S&P inclusion is inevitable.  We all know what happens to share price once they’re included.  Get in now. 

$7.20 avg, lots of shares.  Averaging up on every red day til I run out of dry powder.  NFA.
User_2: No matter how hard you try to make Sofi look like a tech company they will always be a bank company.
