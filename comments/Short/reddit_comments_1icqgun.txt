If your question is "I have $10,000, what do I do?" or other "advice for my personal situation" questions, you should include relevant information, such as the following:

&#x200B;

\* How old are you? What country do you live in?  

\* Are you employed/making income? How much?  

\* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)  

\* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?  

\* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)  

\* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)  

\* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?  

\* And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.  .

User_1: I'm just curious...
Speaking solely to investors (not traders), did anyone here do any significant amounts of buying stocks on Monday during the big dip in some sectors? If you also did any selling, please mention that too, since I'm talking about *significant net buying.*
User_2: Is anyone holding any QNC.v? I just inherited some stocks. I don’t really know what to look at when deciding whether to hold or sell. All my current holdings are in broad market ETFs - VFV and XEQT.
