User_2: This is definitely up there with most regarded plays. At 8% interest as well  ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
User_3: so now we're paying interest to lose money?
User_4: What the fuck
User_5: bro 8%, wtf.
User_6: Imagine having to send a check every month for 36 months to remind you of how stupid you are ... bravo
User_7: royally regarded eh?
User_8: https://preview.redd.it/8bhtc1e0m5ge1.jpeg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9253fcb90030a13efb84f8971130093031773529
User_9: and posted it on $RDDT
User_10: guh ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
User_11: ðŸš©bubble signal
User_12: Lets assume the stock does great this year and goes up 15%. 

$50,000 @ 7.99 interest compounded daily nets you **$54,158.46**

a 15% profit on the stock gets you $57,500. You pay 24% (ill assume your income.)  $1,800 in taxes

57,500-1,800-4,158 = 51,542

So OP, you are risking losing 15-20,000 a year, for the potential gain of a few hundred.
User_13: This is the stuff that's laughable when it comes to "I don't have any money and it's the world's fault, not my decisions"

User_15: Taking debt and playing it in the market has to be the truest form of regard
User_16: https://preview.redd.it/xglwzxlln5ge1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d0545504c3a899389242afa58fe0d8857679824
User_17: Why not just.... Calls at that point
User_18: Hey, what could go wrong? Brilliant play if you ask me. Trump totally won't make some statement about tariffs that spooks the market and Chinese aggression is total nonsense. Fuck the haters;)
User_19: WSB is so back
User_20: This is like top 3 most regarded things I've seen on this sub

I get bullish because of the new DeepSeek paradigm in AI but betting with bankruptcy on TSM while Trump is president and China is ogling Taiwan is special
User_21: ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
User_22: This is a great idea. Everyone should go out right now and take out the largest mortgage their bank will let them. If the apr is less than the annual return you literally can't lose. There is no possible way this could go bad
User_23: I guess not only OP does no DD but neither does Santander
User_24: why on the verge of the tariffs on chips??
User_25: https://preview.redd.it/aqjyjawjl5ge1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d0bdea1058af2aef421883934e2cff55fa25dcf
User_26: you forget to add the 20% Tariff. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225)
User_27: you will get fucked. the market will correct massively soon.
User_28: https://preview.redd.it/6pk210h2n5ge1.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c958e0f1defbbf4121c686d6cf8e8be2079f1b8
User_29: Holy fuck, robinhood offers like 5.5% apr, you'd save several hundred a month.
User_30: Give these guys a call they can help:

1-800-GAMBLER
User_31: Hey FR though 7.99 is a crazy good rate for unsecured.
User_32: Broâ€¦..
User_33: ahead of the tariffs?
User_34: This is one of a few things that caused The Great Depression and im all for it. This bubbles gonna pop!
User_35: This is why Powell didn't cut rates
User_36: 7.99% fixed rate? how the fuck did you get that? is it attached to your mortgage or something?

  
also this doesnt make sense, you have to make 7.99% to break even if you don't account for cap gains tax.
User_37: https://preview.redd.it/8bshk502k5ge1.jpeg?width=688&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddaa2b48277fab64f83bf9684cbee124d2b9adb8
User_38: This is not a yolo, this is going full regard.
User_39: Bold strategy, Cottonâ€¦
User_40: Post history checks out. This is next level degeneracy - keep it up! Surely you wonâ€™t lose literally everything ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224)
User_41: Perfect move! Now make a loan to buy some puts just in-case and you are ready to go as the master regard :)
User_42: Bro Robinhood margin is 5.75% interest rate.
User_43: shouldâ€™ve gotten more
User_44: My dumbass thought the esports team ðŸ˜‚
User_45: The king of wendy![img](emote|t5_2th52|53057)![img](emote|t5_2th52|52627)
User_46: That was very fucking dumb.
User_47: Isn't this company subject to tariffs now?
User_48: Itâ€™s interesting to me how people will go into debt to try and make money from stocks. But wonâ€™t do it with buying a house to rent or a couple and then increase their cash flow.
User_49: [deleted]
User_50: What am I missing here $1,566 per month for 3 years =156.429 weeks $56,300? Sounds reasonable to me?
User_51: Absolutely a bad decision.
User_52: You bought the whole company?!?!
User_53: Nice, after these sweet gains your are only ~3,5k in the red. Just a few more lucky days and you are back to zero, and you better hope nothing bad happens for the remaining 36 months. 


Smart play!
User_54: This guys balls glow in the dark
User_55: They barely dipped from ATH. Highly regarded move. Itâ€™s such a dumb financial move that it might work out in the end because you did it. If I make the same move, Iâ€™d be down a lot.
User_56: Godspeed, dumbass!
User_57: 7.99% isnâ€™t bad for an unsecured loan even in days of lower interest rates. Itâ€™s not like a mortgage or a car loan where thereâ€™s something to recoup if payments canâ€™t be made. 

That being said, op is fucking wild for this lol
User_58: OP is already planning to file bankruptcy. Weâ€™ll all pay for his stupidity. Again.
User_59: Iâ€™ve held some TSM for years now, itâ€™s crazy to me but no matter what else is going on it never really moves more than 10 percent. I thought it would be an infinite money cheat code but itâ€™s pretty lame
User_60: This has to be the dumbest thing Iâ€™ve seen on this sub in the past 5 years. Holy shit.
User_61: 3 year loan at 8% ðŸ˜‚

OP since youâ€™re already making bad decisions turn the dial to max and get another mortgage on your house, sell your car/everything else you own, and take out more loans. Up that 50k bet to a 500k bet and either make it big or file ch7.
User_62: Contrary to all the other comments here, lowkey not a bad play.
User_63: lol 8% loan to buy stock
User_64: Try and refi for a longer term and lower monthly. Less stress and you can let that compound longer
User_65: The loan officer is actively in this thread laughing his ass off I bet.
User_66: What regard gave another regard a loan for gambling.  You truly are one of us.
User_67: Why not just trade on margin at this point?
User_68: You are a crazy man. A total regard.
User_69: Its only dumb if it doesn't work.
User_70: ignore all these REGARDS.  you making money, these REGARDS just jealous of you !
User_71: Donâ€™t let the comments bother you OP the WSB and smooth brain committee approves of this financial decision.
User_72: 8 percent interest?????
User_73: Fuck yeah. I donâ€™t know about yâ€™all but I believe this guy! Remind me later!
User_74: Iâ€™m not crazy into stocks, what am I missing here? It looks like he took a big loan but is making 2 millions of the purchase or am I way off?
User_75: This guy has over $1m in gains on reddit alone. He will be fine lol
User_76: So you're paying interest AND the irs?
User_77: OK, you guys DESERVE your consequences.
User_78: Is this whole subreddit about waiting to see people's poor financial choices fail miserably? 

Because i'm here for it.
User_79: I applaud you. Contrary to what most here say, I think TSM could go up to 250 by the end of 2025 and you will likely make a bit profit out of it.
User_80: You should double in 1 year but fuck, this is risky. What happens if we enter a Civil War. Or if our small brained fat ass pres does something stupid as he usually does??? You'll be fucked. One EO for Tariffs on Semi Conductors and it's over for this stock.
User_81: I've been standoffish on TSM ever since League of Legends.
User_82: I havenâ€™t laughed this hard in awhile. Hey, you didnâ€™t waist $60k. You just spent that much to make my day ðŸ˜‚
User_83: I guess "only invest what you are willing to lose" doesn't apply here. 

Only invest what you don't have if you are willing to lose what you don't have plus a bit extra.
User_84: This is one reason to be against student loan forgiveness. /s
User_85: This has potential to be an all timer
User_86: I did this with MSTR but $33k. Best decision ever
User_87: Sell and buy deep OTM calls so we can laugh heartily (or be happy for you I guess)
User_88: Hope this works out for you, cause I don't see anyone else doing anything, while handing out advice.
User_89: GUH! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
User_90: t smart
User_91: This a hof play
User_92: Good luck
User_93: What you don't understand about don't using a loan for playing with the market ?
User_94: Boy, you guys really fall for any moronic story...
User_95: Well, I guess this is my sell signal ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)
User_96: ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
User_97: That's the interest rate of some with bad credit history or non-existent credit history ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)
