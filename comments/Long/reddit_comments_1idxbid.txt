User_150: God damn, the sheer size of the figures in Apple's earnings reports constantly blow my mind. Their iPhone sales missed estimates by $1.5 billion. But they still sold $69.1 billion of iPhones so its imperceptible. And that's just one product in one quarter of the year. Apple has more money and more power than most countries on Earth.
User_151: My god, listening to the Intel earning call feels like therapy after listening to the Tesla one. Its so...normal...
